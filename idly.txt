Wash and soak rice in a bowl. Wash and soak the black gram and fenugreek seeds in another bowl. Soak both for at least 2-6 hours. I have shared the procedure of making idli batter in detail in a separate post. 
Drain the water and grind the black gram to a smooth paste using a wet grinder or Indian mixie. Remove the batter into a bowl.
Next grind the rice smoothly. Remove the batter into the same bowl.
Add the salt and mix both the batters thoroughly.
Now leave the batter to ferment for 7-12 hours till the batter rises to almost double the size.
To make the idlis, first take about 1 cup of water in the idli cooker or pressure cooker. Keep it on flame and bring to boil.
Grease the idli plates with few drops of oil and fill with idli batter. Fill the molds with the fermented idli batter till it is 3/4 th full.
Place it in the idli cooker. Steam and cook for about 10 minutes.
