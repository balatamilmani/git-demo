Clean and soak the rice and urad dal with bengal gram dal and fenugreek seeds separately or together . Traditionally it used to soaked separately and ground separately. But with modern mixies and grinders you can grind everything together itself.
Similarly overnight soaking is good. But for urgent situations, even 1 hour of soaking will do for modern mixies and grinders.
After soaking, drain and grind it to a smooth paste with salt and water enough to make a batter little thinner than idli batter. If the batter becomes thicker you can always add water later. 
Let this batter ferment overnight till it raises to double its size.
Heat a traditional indalium or cast iron dosa pan. You can also use non stick dosa pans.
The pan should become hot enough so that when you sprinkle few drops of water on the pan, it should sizzle right away.
Just add 3-4 drops of gingelly oil and spread it all over the pan using an onion slice or a clean kitchen towel.
Pour a ladle full of batter. Spread it using the back of the spoon using circular motion to about 9 inch round dosa.
Add few drops of oil around the edges of the dosa.
Once it turns slightly brown and the edges start lifting, flip and brown the other side too.
