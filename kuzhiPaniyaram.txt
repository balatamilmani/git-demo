If you do not want to make a separate batter for make paniyarams, you can use idli/dosa batter too.

Wash and soak the rice together and the urad dal with the fenugreek seeds in a separate bowl for about 4 hours.
Grind it to a smooth paste. Mix salt.
Ferment the batter for about 10 hours (or overnight) till the batter doubles in volume. Now the batter is ready to make paniyarams. You can store it in the refrigerator and make it later too.
